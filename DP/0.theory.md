-   Remember the past
-   Term DP is not related to coding, but it is from literature and means filling tables.
-   DP is applied to **optimization problems.**
-   DP's Properties
    -   **Optimal SubStructure**: An optimal solution to a problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems.
    -   **Overlapping subproblems**: A recursive solution contains a small no of distinct sub problems repeated many times.

**Greedy vs DP**

-   In Greedy techinique, We find optimal solution at each and every stage so that we hope that we can find optimal sol at the very end.
-   In Greedy techinique, choics made may depend on choices made so far but not on future choices.
-   In Greedy techinique, It iteratively one greedy choice after another, reducing each given problem into smaller one.
-   The main difference between greedy and DP was "Greedy never consider it's choices" while "Dp at every stage make choices based on all prev choices".

**Divide and Conquer vs DP**

-   In D n C, subproblems are independent where as in DP there can be overlap of
    sub problems.

**DP = Overlapping SUbProblems + memoization/tabulation**

**Approach 1**

1. calculate state(state is a sub-problem)
2. calculate transition(it is a method to solve state)
3. Define Basecase
4. FInal SubProblem

---

**Approach 2**

1. pruning (out of boundaries)
2. Base case (exit the problem)
3. cache check
4. compute
5. save and return
