# Problem Definition

Given a 2D grid of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence where you can only move right or down from any cell.

#### Example

Consider the following grid:

3 4 5
3 2 6
2 2 7
In this grid, one possible longest increasing subsequence is 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 with length 5.

## Dynamic Programming Approach

1. Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at cell (i, j).
2. Initialize dp with 1 since the smallest LIS ending at each cell is the cell itself.
3. Traverse the grid from top-left to bottom-right. For each cell, update the dp value based on the values from the cell to its left (i, j-1) and the cell above it (i-1, j).
4. The LIS ending at a cell (i, j) is the maximum of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1] plus 1 if the move from (i-1, j) or (i, j-1) is valid (i.e., the value at (i, j) is greater than the value at (i-1, j) or (i, j-1)).
5. The maximum value in dp at the end is the length of the LIS.

#### C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Function to find the length of LIS in a 2D grid
int longestIncreasingSubsequence2D(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();

    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 1));  // Initialize dp array with 1
    int maxLength = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            // Check from the left cell
            if (j > 0 && grid[i][j] > grid[i][j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - 1] + 1);
            }
            // Check from the above cell
            if (i > 0 && grid[i][j] > grid[i - 1][j]) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + 1);
            }
            maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[i][j]);
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = {
        {3, 4, 5},
        {3, 2, 6},
        {2, 2, 7}
    };
    cout << "Length of LIS in 2D Grid: " << longestIncreasingSubsequence2D(grid) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
