[Cherry PickUp](https://leetcode.com/problems/cherry-pickup/)

**Intuition**

-   We have to take the cherries in such a way that it takes maximum of it , reach to (n-1 , n-1) , if possible and also make the taken cheeries as 0 .
-   Now again we have to make one traversal from (n-1 , n-1) to (0 , 0) such that it can take the maximum of the remaining cheeries .
-   Now trying this way will be make our life very hectic
-   Think this questions as two persons are taking cheeries such a way that they following as maximum cheeries as they can take combinely and they cannot take the same cheeries i.e their sum of cheeries taken combinely is maximised , no need of maximising individual .
-   Lets say (r1 , c1) coordinates of person1 , (r2 , c2) coordinates of person2 , now as they both are intially at origin and they move max 1 step each time , we can say that distance of person1 from origin is equal to distance of person2 from origin i.e r1+c1=r2+c2
-   Now take the current cheery of person 1 i.e grid[r1][c1] , if(r1!=r2) i.e they are not at same position , then take the cheery of person2 .
-   There is 4 possibiltity of moving of (person1 , person2) both moving 1 steps each at a time . i.e (right , right) , (right , down) , (down , right) , (down , down) . Find out which path will give the maximum cheeries stores in temp variable and add it to ans variable.
-   Edge cases : if any of one of two persons goes out of bounds or obstacles is present means this is not not possible , return INT_MIN . if( person1 reaches the (n-1 , n-1) then return the grid[n-1][n-1] value ) both reaches simultaneously as r1 + c1=r2+c2 .
-   if(already exists in 3-d dp matrix ) then return dp[r1][c1][r2] .

## Mmoization

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int cherryPickup(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(m, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(n, -1)));
        return max(0, helper(grid, dp, m, n, 0, 0, 0));
    }

    int helper(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<vector<int>>>& dp, int m, int n, int r1, int c1, int c2) {
        int r2 = r1 + c1 - c2;
        // Out of bounds or thorn encountered
        if (r1 >= m || r2 >= m || c1 >= n || c2 >= n || grid[r1][c1] == -1 || grid[r2][c2] == -1)
            return INT_MIN;

        // Base case: reached bottom-right corner
        if (r1 == m - 1 && c1 == n - 1)
            return grid[r1][c1];

        // Check if already computed
        if (dp[r1][c1][c2] != -1)
            return dp[r1][c1][c2];

        // Simultaneous movements of two knights
        int cherries = grid[r1][c1] + (r1 != r2 ? grid[r2][c2] : 0);

        // Try all possible movements for both knights
        int maxCherries = max({helper(grid, dp, m, n, r1 + 1, c1, c2), helper(grid, dp, m, n, r1, c1 + 1, c2),
                               helper(grid, dp, m, n, r1 + 1, c1, c2 + 1), helper(grid, dp, m, n, r1, c1 + 1, c2 + 1)});

        // Update dp table
        dp[r1][c1][c2] = (maxCherries == -1) ? -1 : (cherries + maxCherries);
        return dp[r1][c1][c2];
    }
};
