[Interleaving String](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/)

### Algorithm

-   If both s1 and s2 are empty, i.e., i = 0 and j = 0, then s3 must also be empty. So, table[0][0] is set to true.
-   If s1 is empty, i.e., i = 0, then s3 must be equal to s2. So, table[0][j] is set to true if the current character in s2 matches the corresponding character in s3.
-   If s2 is empty, i.e., j = 0, then s3 must be equal to s1. So, table[i][0] is set to true if the current character in s1 matches the corresponding character in s3.
-   For each position (i, j) in the DP table, we check if s1[i-1] (character at index i-1 in s1) matches s3[i+j-1] (character at index i+j-1 in s3). If it does, then we can consider the possibility of extending the interleaving from the previous state at (i-1, j). This is represented by table[i-1][j].
-   Similarly, we check if s2[j-1] (character at index j-1 in s2) matches s3[i+j-1]. If it does, then we can consider the possibility of extending the interleaving from the previous state at (i, j-1). This is represented by table[i][j-1]

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
 bool isInterleave(string s1, string s2, string s3) {
    int m = s1.length(), n = s2.length();
    if(s3.length() != m + n)
        return false;

    bool dp[m+1][n+1];
    dp[0][0] =true;
    for(int i=1; i<=m; ++i){
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] && s1[i-1] == s3[i-1];
    }
    for(int i=1; i<=n; ++i){
        dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1] && s2[i-1] == s3[i-1];
    }


    for(int i=1; i<m+1; i++)
        for(int j=1; j<n+1; j++){
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] && s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1] ) || (dp[i][j-1] && s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1] );
        }

    return dp[m][n];
}
};
```
