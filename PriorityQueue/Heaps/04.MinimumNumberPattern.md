## 1. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks

You have some sticks with positive integer lengths.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths X and Y into one stick by paying a cost of X + Y. You perform this action until there is one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

Example 1:

Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
Output: 14
Explanation: You start with sticks = [2,4,3].

1. Combine sticks 2 and 3 for a cost of 2 + 3 = 5. Now you have sticks = [5,4].
2. Combine sticks 5 and 4 for a cost of 5 + 4 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9].
   There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 5 + 9 = 14.

Example 2:
Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
Output: 30
Explanation: You start with sticks = [1,8,3,5].

1. Combine sticks 1 and 3 for a cost of 1 + 3 = 4. Now you have sticks = [4,8,5].
2. Combine sticks 4 and 5 for a cost of 4 + 5 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9,8].
3. Combine sticks 9 and 8 for a cost of 9 + 8 = 17. Now you have sticks = [17].
   There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 4 + 9 + 17 = 30.

Input: sticks = [5]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is only one stick, so you don't need to do anything. The total cost is 0.

## 2. Meeting Rooms II

Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

#### M-1. Heap

##### Algorithm

-   Sort the intervals according to the starting time.
-   Use a minHeap(pq) to save the endTime for all intervals according to the order of start time.
    -   Add end time to the pq.
    -   if cur start time < pq.peek() => means current start time is before first ending time, which means we must have a new room.
    -   if cur start time >= pq.peek() => means we can use this room for the meeting, we poll out the the original period and add current period to the pq(Means we update the room with the new meeting).

```cpp
int minMeetingRooms(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        if(intervals.empty()) return 0;
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b){
            return a[0] < b[0];
        });
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
        int room = 0;
        for(const auto& interval : intervals) {
            pq.push(interval[1]);
            if(interval[0] < pq.top()) {
                room++;
            } else {
                pq.pop();
            }
        }
        return room;
    }
```

### M-2. 2 ptrs + sorting

```cpp
int minMeetingRooms(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        vector<int> starts, ends;
        for (auto &v : A) {
            starts.push_back(v[0]);
            ends.push_back(v[1]);
        }
        sort(begin(starts), end(starts));
        sort(begin(ends), end(ends));
        int N = A.size(), ans = 0, cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < N;) {
            if (starts[i] < ends[j]) {
                ++cnt;
                ++i;
                ans = max(ans, cnt);
            } else if (starts[i] > ends[j]) {
                --cnt;
                ++j;
            } else {
                ++i;
                ++j;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

## M-1. map

#### Approach

-   First count the number of occurrences of each element.
-   Let the max frequency seen be M for element E
-   We can schedule the first M-1 occurrences of E, each E will be followed by at least N CPU cycles in between successive schedules of E
-   Total CPU cycles after scheduling M-1 occurrences of E = (M-1) \* (N + 1) // 1 comes for the CPU cycle for E itself
-   Now schedule the final round of tasks. We will need at least 1 CPU cycle of the last occurrence of E. If there are multiple tasks with frequency M, they will all need 1 more cycle.
-   Run through the frequency dictionary and for every element which has frequency == M, add 1 cycle to result.
-   If we have more number of tasks than the max slots we need as computed above we will return the length of the tasks array as we need at least those many CPU cycles.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        int cnt = 0;
        for(auto e: tasks){
            mp[e]++;
            cnt = max(cnt, mp[e]);
        }
        int ans = (cnt-1)*(n+1);

        for(auto e: mp){
            if(cnt == e.second){
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return max((int)tasks.size(),ans);
    }
};
```

### M-2. Heap + Round Robin

#### Approach

The idea is:
To work on the same task again, CPU has to wait for time n, therefore we can think of as if there is a cycle, of time n+1, regardless whether you schedule some other task in the cycle or not.

To avoid leave the CPU with limited choice of tasks and having to sit there cooling down frequently at the end, it is critical the keep the diversity of the task pool for as long as possible.
In order to do that, we should try to schedule the CPU to always try round robin between the most popular tasks at any time.
priority_queue<task, count>

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        unordered_map<char, int> counts;
        for (char t : tasks) {
            counts[t]++;
        }
        priority_queue<pair<int, char>> pq;
        for (pair<char, int> count : counts) {
            pq.push(make_pair(count.second, count.first));
        }
        int alltime = 0;
        int cycle = n + 1;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            int time = 0;
            vector<pair<int, char>> tmp;
            for (int i = 0; i < cycle; i++) {
                if (!pq.empty()) {
                    tmp.push_back(pq.top());
                    pq.pop();
                    time++;
                }
            }
            for (auto t : tmp) {
                if (--t.first) {
                    pq.push(t);
                }
            }
            alltime += !pq.empty() ? cycle : time;
        }
        return alltime;
    }
};
```
