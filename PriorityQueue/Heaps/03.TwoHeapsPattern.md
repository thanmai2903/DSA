1. [ Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/)

### Approach

#### Solution : MaxHeap to store a half of low numbers, MinHeap to store a half of high numbers

-   The idea is to divide numbers into 2 balanced halves, one half low stores low numbers, the other half high stores high numbers. To access the median in O(1), we need a data structure that give us the maximum of low half and the minimum of high half in O(1). That's where maxHeap and minHeap come into play.
-   We use maxHeap to store a half of low numbers, top of the maxHeap is the highest number among low numbers.
-   We use minHeap to store a half of high numbers, top of the minHeap is the lowest number among high numbers.
-   We need to balance the size between maxHeap and minHeap while processing. Hence after adding k elements,
-   If k = 2 \* i then maxHeap.size = minHeap.size = i
-   If k = 2 \* i + 1, let maxHeap store 1 element more than minHeap, then maxHeap.size = minHeap.size + 1.
-   When adding a new number num into our MedianFinder:
-   Firstly, add num to the maxHeap, now maxHeap may contain the big element (which should belong to minHeap). So we need to balance, by removing the highest element from maxHeap, and offer it to minHeap.
-   Now, the minHeap might hold more elements than maxHeap, in that case, we need to balance the size, by removing the lowest element from minHeap and offer it back to maxHeap.
-   When doing findMedian():
-   If maxHeap.size > minHeap.size return top of the maxHeap, which is the highest number amongs low numbers.
-   Else if maxHeap.size == minHeap return the (maxHeap.top() + minHeap.top()) / 2.

```cpp
class MedianFinder {
public:
    priority_queue<int> maxh;
    priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> minh;
    /*
        1) store first half in maxh, second half in minh
        2) maxh can have 1 element more than minh
    */
    void addNum(int num) {
        maxh.push(num);
        minh.push(maxh.top());
        maxh.pop();
        if(minh.size()>maxh.size()){
            maxh.push(minh.top());
            minh.pop();
        }
    }
    double findMedian() {
        if(maxh.size()==minh.size()) return (maxh.top()+minh.top())/2.0;
        return maxh.top();
    }
};
```

#### Another Way

```cpp
class MedianFinder {
private:
    priority_queue<int> firstQ; // max_heap for the first half
    priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int> > secQ; // min_heap for the second half
public:
    // Adds a number into the data structure.
    void addNum(int num) {
        if(firstQ.empty() || (firstQ.top()>num)) firstQ.push(num); // if it belongs to the smaller half
        else secQ.push(num);

        // rebalance the two halfs to make sure the length difference is no larger than 1
        if(firstQ.size() > (secQ.size()+1))
        {
            secQ.push(firstQ.top());
            firstQ.pop();
        }
        else if(firstQ.size()+1<secQ.size())
        {
            firstQ.push(secQ.top());
            secQ.pop();
        }
    }

    // Returns the median of current data stream
    double findMedian() {
        if(firstQ.size() == secQ.size()) return firstQ.empty()?0:( (firstQ.top()+secQ.top())/2.0);
        else return (firstQ.size() > secQ.size())? firstQ.top():secQ.top();
    }
};
```

    int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, vector<int>& profits, vector<int>& capital) {
        int n = profits.size();

            projects[i] = {capital[i], profits[i]};
        }
        //We sort the projects by their minimum capital required in ascending order because we want to consider the projects that we can afford with our current capital. By iterating over the sorted projects, we can ensure that we only consider the projects that have a minimum capital requirement less than or equal to our current capital.
        sort(projects.begin(), projects.end());
        int i = 0;
        priority_queue<int> maximizeCapital;
        while (k--) {
            //The condition projects[i].first <= w checks if the minimum capital requirement of the next project is less than or equal to our current capital w. If this condition is true, we can add the project to the priority queue because we have enough capital to start the project.
            //We use this condition to ensure that we only add the available projects that we can afford to the priority queue. By checking the minimum capital requirement of the next project before adding it to the priority queue, we can avoid adding projects that we cannot afford, and we can focus on selecting the most profitable project that we can afford with our current capital.
            //The loop while (i < n && projects[i].first <= w) runs until we add all the available projects that we can afford to the priority queue
            while (i < n && projects[i].first <= w) {
                maximizeCapital.push(projects[i].second);
                i++;
            }
            if (maximizeCapital.empty())
