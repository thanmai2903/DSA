[Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

### Intuition:

Approach on top of my mind was use hashmap add elements to it and iterate it and find if particular element count is more than n/2 times, here space complexity is O(n), **time : O(n)**

since we need it in space complexity O(1)
Need to use better algo, **moore's voting algorithm**
Here's the intuition broken down into steps:
Initialization: Begin with two variables: a candidate for the majority element and a counter initialized to 0.

**Voting Phase:** Iterate through the sequence. For each element:

-   If the counter is 0, set the current element as the candidate.
-   If the current element is the same as the candidate, increment the counter.
-   If the current element is different from the candidate, decrement the counter.

**Verification Phase:** After the voting phase, the candidate might be the majority element, but it needs to be verified:

-   Iterate through the sequence again, counting the occurrences of the candidate.
-   If the count exceeds n/2, where n is the length of the sequence, then the candidate is indeed the majority element.

but we can combine both voting and verification phase so problem can be solved in one pass

**SC: O(1) and TC O(n)**

### Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();

        int majIdx = 0, cnt = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; ++i){
            if(nums[i] == nums[majIdx]){
                cnt++;
            }else{
                cnt--;
                if(cnt == 0){
                    majIdx = i;
                    cnt = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return nums[majIdx];
    }
};
```
