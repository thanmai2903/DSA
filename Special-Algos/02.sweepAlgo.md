## [Count Days Without Meetings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-days-without-meetings/)

You are given a positive integer days representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array meetings of size n where, meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i] represents the starting and ending days of meeting i (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

Note: The meetings may overlap.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countDays(int days, vector<vector<int>>& meetings) {
        vector<pair<int, int>> events;
        for(auto& e: meetings){
            events.push_back({e[0], 1});
            events.push_back({e[1], -1});
        }

        events.push_back({0,0});
        events.push_back({days+1, 0});

        sort(begin(events), end(events));
        int res = 0;
        int running_events = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<size(events)-1; ++i){
            running_events += events[i].second;
            if(running_events == 0){
                //Gap between this to next => [...,2, 4,...] -> 4-2-1 = 1 => 1 day have no meeting
                res += max(events[i+1].first - events[i].first - 1, 0);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
