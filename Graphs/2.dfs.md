# DFS

### Recursive DFS

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void dfsRecursive(int vertex, vector<vector<int>>& adjList, vector<bool>& visited) {
    // Mark the current vertex as visited
    visited[vertex] = true;
    cout << vertex << " ";

    // Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex
    for (int adjacent : adjList[vertex]) {
        if (!visited[adjacent]) {
            dfsRecursive(adjacent, adjList, visited);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 5; // Number of vertices
    vector<vector<int>> adjList(n);

    // Example graph edges
    adjList[0] = {1, 2};
    adjList[1] = {0, 3, 4};
    adjList[2] = {0};
    adjList[3] = {1};
    adjList[4] = {1};

    vector<bool> visited(n, false); // To keep track of visited vertices

    cout << "DFS starting from vertex 0:" << endl;
    dfsRecursive(0, adjList, visited);

    return 0;
}
```

### Iterative DFS

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

void dfsIterative(int start, vector<vector<int>>& adjList) {
    vector<bool> visited(adjList.size(), false);
    stack<int> s;
    s.push(start);

    while (!s.empty()) {
        int vertex = s.top();
        s.pop();

        if (!visited[vertex]) {
            cout << vertex << " ";
            visited[vertex] = true;
        }

        // Push all adjacent vertices to the stack
        for (int adjacent : adjList[vertex]) {
            if (!visited[adjacent]) {
                s.push(adjacent);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 5; // Number of vertices
    vector<vector<int>> adjList(n);

    // Example graph edges
    adjList[0] = {1, 2};
    adjList[1] = {0, 3, 4};
    adjList[2] = {0};
    adjList[3] = {1};
    adjList[4] = {1};

    cout << "Iterative DFS starting from vertex 0:" << endl;
    dfsIterative(0, adjList);

    return 0;
}
```

# Type:1 DFS From Boundary

[Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/description/)

```
You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture regions that are surrounded:

Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
Region: To form a region connect every 'O' cell.
Surround: The region is surrounded with 'X' cells if you can connect the region with 'X' cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the board.
A surrounded region is captured by replacing all 'O's with 'X's in the input matrix board.
```

#### Example 1:

Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

#### Intuition:

-   we have make all "O" except at boundarys to "X"
-   Firstly tranform all "O" in boundary to "#"
-   In a matrix, COnvert all "O" to "X" ans all "#" to "O"

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        int m = board.size(), n = board[0].size();
        for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'O' && (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == n - 1))
                    helper(board, i, j);
            }
        }
        //if cell = 'O' => not connected to border => surrouned region => change to 'X'
        //if cell = '#' =>  connected to border => not a surrouned region => change to 'O'
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'O')
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                else if (board[i][j] == '#')
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
            }
        }
    }

    void helper(vector<vector<char>>& board, int i, int j) {
        if(i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size()) {
            return;
        }

        if(board[i][j] == 'O') {
            board[i][j] = '#';
            helper(board, i + 1, j);
            helper(board, i, j - 1);
            helper(board, i, j + 1);
            helper(board, i - 1, j);
        }
    }
};
```

[No Of Enclaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-enclaves/)

```
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid, where 0 represents a sea cell and 1 represents a land cell.

A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally) land cell or walking off the boundary of the grid.

Return the number of land cells in grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.
```

#### Example

Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that is not enclosed because its on the boundary.

#### Intuition:

-   Here, We have to find how many lands inside boundary that don't make up to reach boundary.
-   FIrs Do DFS for land cells '1' on boundary and mark them as '2'
-   Just count no of land cell '1' with DFS => ans

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numEnclaves(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        int m = board.size(), n = board[0].size();
        for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 1 && (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == n - 1))
                    helper(board, i, j);
            }
        }
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 1)
                    cnt++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
    void helper(vector<vector<int>>& board, int i, int j) {
        if(i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size()) {
            return;
        }

        if(board[i][j] == 1) {
            board[i][j] = 2;
            helper(board, i + 1, j);
            helper(board, i, j - 1);
            helper(board, i, j + 1);
            helper(board, i - 1, j);
        }
    }
};
```

# Type:2 DFS ON ISLANDS

[Number of Closed Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands/description/)

```
Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

Return the number of closed islands.
```

#### Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).

#### Intuition

-   Here 1 -> water, 0 -> land
-   closed island => all 0's dfs indide boundary
-   Firstly do DFS for all 0's in boundary and mark them as 1
-   Do dfs for 0's inside boundary and cnt the number => ans

#### Code

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int closedIsland(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        int m = board.size(), n = board[0].size();
        for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 0 && (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == n - 1))
                    helper(board, i, j);
            }
        }
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 0){
                    helper(board, i, j);
                    cnt++;
                }
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
    void helper(vector<vector<int>>& board, int i, int j) {
        if(i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || board[i][j] == 1) {
            return;
        }

            board[i][j] = 1;
            helper(board, i + 1, j);
            helper(board, i, j - 1);
            helper(board, i, j + 1);
            helper(board, i - 1, j);

    }
};
```

[No Of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

```
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
```

#### Example `:

Input: grid = [
["1","1","0","0","0"],
["1","1","0","0","0"],
["0","0","1","0","0"],
["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

#### Intuition

-   Here 1-> land, 0-> water
-   Calculate No of island that are 4 DImensionally connected => count no of 1's in DFS => ans

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j, int m, int n){
        if(i<0 || i>=m || j<0 || j>=n || grid[i][j] == '0'){
            return;
        }
        //Mark as visited
        grid[i][j] ='0';
        dfs(grid,i-1,j,m,n);
        dfs(grid,i+1,j,m,n);
        dfs(grid,i,j-1,m,n);
        dfs(grid,i,j+1,m,n);
    }
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(),n=grid[0].size();
        if(m == 0) return 0;
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0; i<m; ++i){
            for(int j=0; j<n; ++j){
                if(grid[i][j] == '1'){
                    dfs(grid, i, j, m, n);
                    ans++;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

[Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/)

```
There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.
```

#### Example 1:

Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation:
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.

#### Intuition

-   Just Simple DFS starting from node 0
-   Keep visited array, visit every adj of node
-   Loop through if any one is unvisited => return false else true.

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canVisitAllRooms(vector<vector<int>>& rooms) {
        int n = rooms.size();
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);

        // Start the DFS from room 0
        dfs(rooms, visited, 0);

        // Check if all rooms have been visited
        for (bool v : visited) {
            if (!v) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

private:
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& rooms, vector<bool>& visited, int room) {
        // Mark the current room as visited
        visited[room] = true;

        // Visit all adjacent rooms
        for (int key : rooms[room]) {
            if (!visited[key]) {
                dfs(rooms, visited, key);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

[Max Area Of a Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/description/)

```
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
```

#### Example

![i](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, int m, int n){
        if(i<0 || i>=m || j<0 || j>=n || grid[i][j] == 0) return 0;
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        return 1 + (dfs(grid,i-1,j,m,n)+dfs(grid,i+1,j,m,n)+dfs(grid,i,j+1,m,n)+dfs(grid,i,j-1,m,n));
    }
    int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(),n=grid[0].size();
        int maxArea=0;

        for(int i=0; i<m; ++i){
            for(int j=0; j<n; ++j){
                if(grid[i][j] == 1){
                    int area;
                    area = dfs(grid,i,j,m,n);
                    maxArea = max(maxArea,area);
                }
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
};
```

[Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill)

```
An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.

Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
```

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> floodFill(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int color) {
        int prevColor = image[sr][sc];
        vector<vector<bool>> vis(image.size(), vector<bool>(image[0].size(), false));
        dfs(image, sr, sc, prevColor, color, vis);
        return image;
    }
private:
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int prevColor, int color, vector<vector<bool>>& vis){
        if(sr < 0 || sr >= size(image) || sc < 0 || sc >= size(image[0]) || image[sr][sc] != prevColor || vis[sr][sc]){
            return ;
        }
        image[sr][sc] = color;
        vis[sr][sc] = true;
        dfs(image, sr+1, sc, prevColor, color, vis);
        dfs(image, sr-1, sc, prevColor, color, vis);
        dfs(image, sr, sc-1, prevColor, color, vis);
        dfs(image, sr, sc+1, prevColor, color, vis);
    }
};
```

**or**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> floodFill(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int color) {
        int prevColor = image[sr][sc];
        // If the new color is the same as the old color, no need to do anything
        if (prevColor != color) {
            dfs(image, sr, sc, prevColor, color);
        }
        return image;
    }
private:
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int prevColor, int color) {
        // Boundary checks and whether the current cell matches the original color
        if (sr < 0 || sr >= image.size() || sc < 0 || sc >= image[0].size() || image[sr][sc] != prevColor) {
            return;
        }

        // Fill the current cell with the new color
        image[sr][sc] = color;

        // Recursively fill the neighboring cells
        dfs(image, sr + 1, sc, prevColor, color);
        dfs(image, sr - 1, sc, prevColor, color);
        dfs(image, sr, sc + 1, prevColor, color);
        dfs(image, sr, sc - 1, prevColor, color);
    }
};
```

[Coloring a border](leetcode.com/problems/coloring-a-border/)

```
You are given an m x n integer matrix grid, and three integers row, col, and color. Each value in the grid represents the color of the grid square at that location.

Two squares are called adjacent if they are next to each other in any of the 4 directions.

Two squares belong to the same connected component if they have the same color and they are adjacent.

The border of a connected component is all the squares in the connected component that are either adjacent to (at least) a square not in the component, or on the boundary of the grid (the first or last row or column).

You should color the border of the connected component that contains the square grid[row][col] with color.

Return the final grid.
```

#### Intuition

1. Perform a DFS to identify all cells in the connected component starting from (sr, sc).
2. During the DFS, identify the border cells.
3. After the DFS, change the color of the identified border cells to the new color.

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {

    vector<vector<int>> colorBorder(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int r0, int c0, int color) {
        int prevColor = grid[r0][c0];
        vector<vector<bool>> vis(grid.size(), vector<bool>(grid[0].size(), false));
        vector<pair<int, int>> borders;
        dfs(grid, r0, c0, prevColor, vis, borders);

        for (auto& border : borders) {
            grid[border.first][border.second] = color;
        }

        return grid;
    }

private:

            return;
        }

        vis[sr][sc] = true;

        bool isBorder = sr == 0 || sr == grid.size() - 1 || sc == 0 || sc == grid[0].size() - 1;

            } else if (!vis[newSr][newSc]) {
                dfs(grid, newSr, newSc, prevColor, vis, borders);
            }
        }

};
```

#### Approach-2

1. From an initial point, perform DFS and flip the cell color to negative to track visited cells.

2. After DFS is complete for the cell, check if this cell is inside. If so, flip its color back to the positive.

3. In the end, cells with the negative color are on the border. Change their color to the target color.

```cpp
void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& g, int r, int c, int cl) {
  if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= g.size() || c >= g[r].size() || g[r][c] != cl) return;
  g[r][c] = -cl;
  dfs(g, r - 1, c, cl);
  dfs(g, r + 1, c, cl);
  dfs(g, r, c - 1, cl);
  dfs(g, r, c + 1, cl);
  if (r > 0 && r < g.size() - 1 && c > 0 && c < g[r].size() - 1 && cl == abs(g[r - 1][c]) &&
    cl == abs(g[r + 1][c]) && cl == abs(g[r][c - 1]) && cl == abs(g[r][c + 1]))
    g[r][c] = cl;
}
vector<vector<int>> colorBorder(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int r0, int c0, int color) {
  dfs(grid, r0, c0, grid[r0][c0]);
  for (auto i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i)
    for (auto j = 0; j < grid[i].size(); ++j) grid[i][j] = grid[i][j] < 0 ? color : grid[i][j];
  return grid;
}
```
