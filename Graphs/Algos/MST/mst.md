# Minimum Spanning Tree

-   A minimum spanning tree (MST) is defined as a spanning tree that has the minimum weight among all the possible spanning trees.
-   A spanning tree is defined as a tree-like subgraph of a connected, undirected graph that includes all the vertices of the graph.
-   It is a subset of the edges of the graph that forms a tree (acyclic) where every node of the graph is a part of the tree.
-   The minimum spanning tree has all the properties of a spanning tree with an added constraint of having the minimum possible weights among all possible spanning trees.

# Properties of a Spanning Tree:

-   If V -> No fo vertices ina graph, then No of edges in spanning tree is V-1.
-   A spanning tree does not have a cycle.
-   ST should not be disconnnected.
-   Acyclic
-   Can be many possible spanning trees in a graph.
