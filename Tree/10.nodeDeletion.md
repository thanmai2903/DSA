1. [Delete Nodes And Return Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest/)

**Intuition**

1. **DFS Traversal**:
    - The algorithm traverses the tree in a depth-first manner, visiting each node and its children.
2. **Marking Nodes for Deletion**:

    - If a node's value is found in the `to_delete` vector, it is marked for deletion.
    - The `deleted` flag helps to control whether a node should be included in the modified tree.

3. **Identifying Root Nodes**:

    - The `isRoot` flag is used to identify whether the current node is the root of the entire tree.
    - If it is the root and not marked for deletion, it is added to the `ans` vector.

4. **Tree Modification**:

    - The algorithm modifies the tree in place by returning `nullptr` for nodes marked for deletion.
    - This effectively removes the node from its parent's connection.

5. **Result**:
    - The `ans` vector contains the root nodes of the subtrees after the specified nodes are deleted.

**Algorithm**

1. **Start**: Begin with the root of the tree and perform a depth-first search (DFS).
2. **Traversal**: For each node encountered during the DFS:
    - Check if the node's value is in the `to_delete` vector.
    - If the node is in the `to_delete` vector:
        - Mark it for deletion and remove its value from the `to_delete` vector.
    - If the node is the root of the entire tree (`isRoot` is **true**) and it is not marked for deletion:
        - Add it to the `ans` vector.
    - Recursively process the left and right children of the node.
    - If the node is marked for deletion, return `nullptr` to remove it from its parent's connection.
    - Otherwise, return the original node.

### DFS

```cpp
class Solution{
 public:
 vector<TreeNode*> ans;

    vector<TreeNode*> delNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& to_delete) {
        dfs(root, to_delete, true);  // Pass 'true' for the root node
        return ans;
    }

    TreeNode* dfs(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& to_delete, bool isRoot) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;

        bool deleted = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < to_delete.size(); ++i) {
            if (to_delete[i] == root->val) {
                deleted = true;
                to_delete.erase(to_delete.begin() + i);
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isRoot && !deleted) {
            ans.push_back(root);
        }

        root->left = dfs(root->left, to_delete, deleted);
        root->right = dfs(root->right, to_delete, deleted);

        return deleted ? nullptr : root;
    }
};
```

2. [Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)

### Approach

-   Recursively search for node to be deleted.
-   Once we find the node to be deleted,
-   If the root is a leaf node, then return NULL. (Base Case).
-   Else if the root has only the left child, then we delete the root node and return its left child.
-   Else if the root has only the right child, then we delete the root node and return its right child.
-   Else, we find the inorder successor node, set the key of root with the key of the inorder successor, and delete the inorder successor. To find the inorder successor, we need to find the node with the minimum key in the right subtree.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
        if(!root) return root;
        if(root->val > key){
            root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
        }else if(root->val < key){
            root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
        }else{
            if(!root->left && !root->right){
                delete(root);
                return NULL;
            }else if(!root->left || !root->right){
                TreeNode* p = root->left? root->left : root->right;
                delete(root);
                return p;
            }else if(root->left && root->right){
                TreeNode* tmp = root->right;
                while(tmp->left){
                    tmp =tmp->left;
                }
                root->val = tmp->val;
                root->right = deleteNode(root->right, tmp->val);
            }
        }
        return root;
    }

};
```
