1. [Validate Binary Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-tree-nodes/description/)

### Approach 1: Depth First Search (DFS)

Intuition

A Tree is a Valid Binary Tree if:

-   only one root(no multiple roots)
-   no multiple components
-   no cycles present

One way to solve this problem would be to perform a DFS on the tree and check that all the rules are followed. Before we can start a DFS, we need to locate the root. Let's define a function findRoot that helps us find the root.

As mentioned above, the root has no parent - this also means that the root is not the child of any nodes. The input arrays leftChild and rightChild describe all children, so the root would not appear in these arrays. We can simply use a for loop from 0 to n - 1 and for each number, check if it is present in leftChild or rightChild. If it's not present in either, then we can return it as the root. If we don't find any root, we can return -1.

To improve efficiency, we will convert leftChild and rightChild to a set for O(1)O(1)O(1) checks.

Once we have the root, we can start a DFS from it. We will implement the DFS iteratively with a stack. How can we validate the tree? First of all, if we see a node multiple times during the DFS, it means a node has multiple parents (and there could be a cycle). We will use a set seen that keeps track of all the nodes we have seen so far during the traversal. When we move to a child, if child is already in seen, we can immediately return false since we would be visiting child for the second time.

Once the DFS finishes, every node we visited will be in seen. If the tree is connected, then the length of seen will be equal to n. If seen.length != n, it means that some nodes were not visited, and thus the tree must be disconnected. Thus, we can return seen.length == n at the end of the algorithm.

This process is sufficient in validating a binary tree:

1. If a binary tree does not have a root, then findRoot will return -1.
2. If there is a node with more than one parent, then we will detect it with seen.
3. If the tree is disconnected, then seen will hold less than n nodes at the end.
4. If there is a cycle, then we will detect it with seen.

Every node other than the root must have exactly one parent.

You may be thinking: we are explicitly checking the case when a node has multiple parents with seen, but what if there is a node with no parent other than the root? That is, what if there are multiple roots? In that scenario, findRoot would give us the root with the lowest value. We would perform a DFS from there, and never reach any of the other roots. Then at the end, seen would have less than n nodes.

### Algorithm

1. Define a function findRoot that gives us the root, as described above.
2. Obtain root = findRoot(). If root == -1, then return false.
3. Initialize a stack and set seen with root in them.
4. While the stack is not empty:
    - Pop the top of the stack as node.
    - Iterate over the children of node, given in leftChild[node] and rightChild[node]. For each child:
        - If child == -1, then ignore it as it means there is no child.
        - If child is in seen, return false.
        - Push child to the stack and add it to seen.
5. After the DFS, return seen.length == n.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool validateBinaryTreeNodes(int n, vector<int>& leftChild, vector<int>& rightChild) {
        int root = findRoot(n, leftChild, rightChild);
        if (root == -1) {
            return false;
        }

        unordered_set<int> seen;
        stack<int> stack;
        seen.insert(root);
        stack.push(root);

        while (!stack.empty()) {
            int node = stack.top();
            stack.pop();

            int children[] = {leftChild[node], rightChild[node]};
            for (int child : children) {
                if (child != -1) {
                    if (seen.find(child) != seen.end()) {
                        return false;
                    }

                    stack.push(child);
                    seen.insert(child);
                }
            }
        }

        return seen.size() == n;
    }

    int findRoot(int n, vector<int>& left, vector<int>& right) {
        unordered_set<int> children;
        children.insert(left.begin(), left.end());
        children.insert(right.begin(), right.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (children.find(i) == children.end()) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Approach 2 : BFS

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool validateBinaryTreeNodes(int n, vector<int>& leftChild, vector<int>& rightChild) {
        int root = findRoot(n, leftChild, rightChild);
        if (root == -1) {
            return false;
        }

        unordered_set<int> seen;
        queue<int> queue;
        seen.insert(root);
        queue.push(root);

        while (!queue.empty()) {
            int node = queue.front();
            queue.pop();

            int children[] = {leftChild[node], rightChild[node]};
            for (int child : children) {
                if (child != -1) {
                    if (seen.find(child) != seen.end()) {
                        return false;
                    }

                    queue.push(child);
                    seen.insert(child);
                }
            }
        }

        return seen.size() == n;
    }

    int findRoot(int n, vector<int>& left, vector<int>& right) {
        unordered_set<int> children;
        children.insert(left.begin(), left.end());
        children.insert(right.begin(), right.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (children.find(i) == children.end()) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```

2. [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

### Approach - 1 : Inorder traversal of BST gives sorted order(ascending order)

```cpp

class Solution {
private:
    vector<int> tree;
public:
    void inOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root)
            return;
        inOrder(root->left);
        tree.push_back(root->val);
        inOrder(root->right);
    }

    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root)
            return true;

        inOrder(root);
        for (int i=1; i<tree.size(); i++)
            if (tree[i] <= tree[i-1])
                return false;
        return true;
    }

};
```

### Approach-2: DFS

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        long long int l = -1000000000000, h = 1000000000000;
        return helper(root,l,h);
    }
    bool helper(TreeNode* node, long long l, long long h){
        if(node == nullptr) return true;
        if(node->val > l && node->val < h) return helper(node->left,l,node->val) && helper(node->right,node->val,h);
        return false;
    }
};
```
