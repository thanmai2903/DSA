[subsets 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)

## Print all the Unique Subsets

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers that may contain duplicates the task is to return all possible subsets. Return only unique subsets and they can be in any order.

Example 1:

Input: array[] = [1,2,2]

Output: [ [ ],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2] ]

Explanation: We can have subsets ranging from length 0 to 3. which are listed above. Also the subset [1,2] appears twice but is printed only once as we require only unique subsets.

Input: array[] = [1]

Output: [ [ ], [1] ]

Explanation: Only two unique subsets are available

```cpp
class Solution {
   private:
      void findSubsets(int ind, vector < int > & nums, vector < int > & ds, vector < vector < int >> & ans) {
         ans.push_back(ds);
         for (int i = ind; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (i != ind && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;
            ds.push_back(nums[i]);
            findSubsets(i + 1, nums, ds, ans);
            ds.pop_back();
         }
      }
   public:
      vector < vector < int >> subsetsWithDup(vector < int > & nums) {
         vector < vector < int >> ans;
         vector < int > ds;
         sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
         findSubsets(0, nums, ds, ans);
         return ans;
      }
};
```

**Time Complexity:** O(2^n) for generating every subset and O(k) to insert every subset in another data structure if the average length of every subset is k. Overall O(k \* 2^n).

**Space Complexity:** O(2^n \* k) to store every subset of average length k. Auxiliary space is O(n) if n is the depth of the recursion tree.
