## Subset Sum : Sum of all Subsets

Problem Statement: Given an array print all the sum of the subset generated from it, in the increasing order.

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, arr[] = {5,2,1}

Output: 0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8

Explanation: We have to find all the subset’s sum and print them.in this case the generated subsets are [ [], [1], [2], [2,1], [5], [5,1], [5,2]. [5,2,1],so the sums we get will be 0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8

Input: N=3,arr[]= {3,1,2}

Output: 0,1,2,3,3,4,5,6

Explanation: We have to find all the subset’s sum and print them.in this case the generated subsets are [ [], [1], [2], [2,1], [3], [3,1], [3,2]. [3,2,1],so the sums we get will be 0,1,2,3,3,4,5,6

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
class Solution {
  public:
    void subsetSumsHelper(int ind, vector < int > & arr, int n, vector < int > & ans, int sum) {
      if (ind == n) {
        ans.push_back(sum);
        return;
      }
      //element is picked
      subsetSumsHelper(ind + 1, arr, n, ans, sum + arr[ind]);
      //element is not picked
      subsetSumsHelper(ind + 1, arr, n, ans, sum);
    }
  vector < int > subsetSums(vector < int > arr, int n) {
    vector < int > ans;
    subsetSumsHelper(0, arr, n, ans, 0);
    sort(ans.begin(), ans.end());
    return ans;
  }
};


int main() {
  vector < int > arr{3,1,2};
  Solution ob;
  vector < int > ans = ob.subsetSums(arr, arr.size());
  sort(ans.begin(), ans.end());
  cout<<"The sum of each subset is "<<endl;
  for (auto sum: ans) {
    cout << sum << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

The sum of each subset is
0 1 2 3 3 4 5 6

**Time Complexity:** O(2^n)+O(2^n log(2^n)). Each index has two ways. You can either pick it up or not pick it. So for n index time complexity for O(2^n) and for sorting it will take (2^n log(2^n)).

**Space Complexity:** O(2^n) for storing subset sums, since 2^n subsets can be generated for an array of size n.
