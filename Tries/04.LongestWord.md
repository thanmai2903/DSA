[Longest Word in Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary)

## M-1. Sort

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    string longestWord(vector<string>& words) {
        sort(words.begin(), words.end());
        unordered_set<string> builtWords;
        string longest = "";

        for (const string& word : words) {
            if (word.size() == 1 || builtWords.count(word.substr(0, word.size() - 1))) {
                // If the word has length 1 or its prefix is already built, consider it
                builtWords.insert(word);

                // Update the longest word
                if (word.size() > longest.size() || (word.size() == longest.size() && word < longest)) {
                    longest = word;
                }
            }
        }

        return longest;
    }
};
```

The **time complexity** is O(n \* log(n)), and the **space complexity** is O(n + m). Here, n is the number of words, and m is the length of the longest word.

## M-2. Trie

```cpp
class Trie {
public:
    unordered_map<char, Trie*> children;
    bool end;

    Trie() {
        end = false;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    string ans = "";

    void insert(string w, Trie* root) {
        string s = "";
        int n = w.length();
        Trie* cur = root;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i == n - 1)
                s += w[i];
            char ch = w[i];
            if (cur->children.find(ch) == cur->children.end()) {
                if (i != n - 1)
                    break;
                cur->children[ch] = new Trie();
            } else
                s += w[i];
            cur = cur->children[ch];
        }

        if (s.length() > ans.length())
            ans = s;
        else if (s.length() == ans.length() && s < ans)
            ans = s;
        cur->end = true;
    }

    string longestWord(vector<string>& words) {
        int n = words.size();
        sort(begin(words), end(words));
        Trie* root = new Trie();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i + 1 < n && words[i] == words[i + 1])
                continue;
            insert(words[i], root);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity (TC):**

-   Sorting the input array of words: O(n \* log(n)), where n is the number of words.
-   Iterating through the sorted array and calling the insert function for each word: O(n \* m), where m is the average length of the words.
-   Overall, the time complexity is O(n _ log(n)) + O(n _ m), which simplifies to O(n \* (log(n) + m)).

**Space Complexity (SC):**

-   Creating a Trie structure: O(1) since the Trie structure is constant size (26 characters).
-   Creating the ans string: O(m), where m is the length of the longest word encountered.
-   The space complexity is primarily determined by the Trie and the ans string. The Trie structure will have a space complexity of O(n \* m), where n is the number of unique words, and m is the average length of the words.
-   So, the overall space complexity is O(n \* m).
