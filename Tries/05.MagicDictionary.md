## Time Complexity (TC):

-   The `insert` function has a time complexity of O(L), where L is the length of the inserted word, as it involves traversing the Trie for each character.
-   The `buildDict` function has a time complexity of O(N \* L), where N is the number of words in the dictionary, and L is the average length of the words, as it inserts each word into the Trie.
-   The `find` function has a time complexity of O(L), where L is the length of the input string, as it traverses the Trie to check if the string exists.
-   The `search` function has a time complexity of O(L _ 26 _ L), where L is the length of the input string, as it iterates over each character, swaps it with 26 different characters, and performs a `find` operation for each permutation.

## Space Complexity (SC):

-   The space complexity of the Trie is O(N \* L), where N is the number of words in the dictionary, and L is the average length of the words, as each character in each word needs to be stored in a TrieNode.
-   Additional space is used for recursion in the `search` function, which can go up to O(L) due to the depth of the recursive calls.
-   Overall, the space complexity is dominated by the Trie structure, resulting in O(N \* L) space complexity.
